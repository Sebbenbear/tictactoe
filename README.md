# Tic Tac Toe

A small game of Tic Tac Toe run on the command line.

## Instructions

Run with:

`python ticTacToe.py`.

## Extras

I would like to start by implementing the basic game, and then extend it to include the following:

- Unit tests
- More error handling for entering in the wrong square
- Docstrings for each method
- The option for a Computer player
- Multiple games
- A smarter Computer Player
- A GUI
